# Calendar-bot.py
• This tool was created to ease the interfacing among our Google Sheets studio schedules, Google Calendar studio schedules, and the Joan display boards in front of each studio.
  o The Joan boards require schedule information in the form of a Google Calendar, but programming and training need Google Sheet             schedules. The sheets allow ease of access to information, are easier to manipulate, and allow access to edit history to view schedule     changes, among other benefits.
• In essence, this program translates Google Sheet information into Google Calendar information, which is then read and displayed by the Joan boards.
# Slack_Bot.py
• Tasked with notifying the training department Slack groupchat if someone has signed up for volunteer training who has not yet been contacted.
# Sort_File_Names.py
• This tool helps organize DJ recordings based on the time and date they were created. .mp3 files are named in the format "MMDDYYYYHHMMSS" and had to be updated every week to reflect date changes.
# Weekly_UI.py
• My first attempt at a UI via the command line. quickly opens webpages and shortens the process of filling out a .pdf timesheet by clearing old data and sending the form via email once completed. Previously set to launch at startup.
# new_volunteers_Online.py
• This tool was created to automatically initiate contact with anyone who expresses interest in Volunteering with Impact89FM based on the team(s) that they indicate when signing up. This example only includes our DJ teams, but lines 48-86 are copied and edited slightly to include the other 7 teams.
